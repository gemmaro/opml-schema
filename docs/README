OPML RELAX NG Schema

The purpose of this RELAX NG schema is to provide a computer-readable and
validatable guide to the OPML 1.0 and 2.0 specifications as defined at
www.opml.org:

- OPML 2.0 - http://opml.org/spec2
- OPML 1.0 - http://opml.org/spec

The specifications upon which the schema is based are copyright to UserLand
Software, Inc. and Scripting News, Inc. See the specification pages above for
details of the copyright. As per the copyright notices of those documents, the
UserLand and Scripting News copyright notice is included in this bundle at
docs/UL-SN-DISCLAIMER, which I humbly request you include with forked copies.

The source for this project is managed using the open-source version control 
and source control management tool, Git. Please see http://git.or.cz for 
details on how to use Git. Trust me, it's cool. Once you start using it, 
you'll wish that Subversion and CVS etc. would go away and the world would 
start using Git.

Please feel free to send patches to me - tom@tommorris.org - for inclusion in
the central repository. Patches sought include both cleaning up and making
more expressive the existing behaviour.

I am currently seeking out the best way to implement vendor- and
user-extensibility to the schema. I'd like to hear your input.

I am also planning to add a test suite which would include a set of valid OPML 1.0 and 2.0 documents so that schema changes can be tested against existing documents for compatibility purposes.
